# Random Biome Mod

Random Biome Mod creates new biomes every time you make a new world. This means that every world you create will be totally unique!
This is just meant as a proof of concept mod so there might be really big issues. The biggest issues currently are:
* Multiplayer doesn't work
* Saving and loading a world creates ugly biome edges
* Random crashes

Therefore I highly discourage the use of this mod with existing worlds. You should really use this with a new world, otherwise you may break a lot of stuff. Thanks, SuperCoder79
